                <h2>Welcome to the Elementary School</h2>

                <p>Our Elementary School program is housed in three adjacent buildings, serving students from the Child
                    Development Center (3 year olds) through Grade Five. The Elementary Staff consists of certified and
                    talented teachers from the United States, Canada, and New Zealand, supported by instructional
                    assistants, technology support staff, guidance counselors, secretaries, two assistant principals,
                    and one principal.</p>

                <p>The Child Development Center students have half-day programs, whereas, the Kindergarten I and
                    Kindergarten II students remain until 1:00 PM. The instructional program in Grades 1 through 5 is an
                    outstanding integrated American curriculum, based on the Common Core State Standards. Our students’
                    educational experience is strengthened by special offerings in Arabic, Library, Computers, Science
                    Lab, Art, Drama, Music, and Physical Education and concludes at 2:00 PM. In the Elementary School,
                    we are committed to developing the "whole" child through a rigorous academic and social
                    curriculum.</p>

                <p>In the regular classroom, students are given opportunities to develop the skills necessary to be
                    successful in the global community of the 21st century. Students are asked to apply this knowledge
                    in the classroom and beyond. Students also have opportunities to participate in a range of
                    educational opportunities through field trips, school-wide events, and a variety of after-school
                    activities. We work to ensure that the Elementary School is a safe, secure, and educationally
                    enriching environment for children.</p>

                <p>The Elementary Faculty is characterized by compassion, caring and commitment to the education of our
                    children. We believe that children learn in many ways and, therefore, employ a variety of teaching
                    methods and styles. We also believe in the intrinsic value of learning and that children learn best
                    when actively applying concepts in real-life situations. We are a community of learners who practice
                    compassion, make a difference, and learn for life.</p>

                <h6><a href="mailto:caleys@ask.edu.kw">Steven Caley</a>, Principal</h6>

                <p>Welcome to the Elementary School webpage! Our mission is to inspire life-long learners to excel in
                    American Higher Education and the global community as productive, compassionate citizens.</p>

                <p>I look forward to working with you to ensure that all of our students are to achieve academic and
                    social success. Our future is founded not only upon the civility and compassion that we can
                    stimulate in today’s students but in their ability to adapt, change and grow in light of rapidly
                    changing realities.</p>

                <p>To be successful, students need to be critical thinkers, creative problem solvers, lifelong learners
                    and effective communicators. So too, will the adults who work with them. Education is a continual
                    process of reimagining and refining a vision of who we are as individuals and how we relate to one
                    another. Our office is always open for you to come in and share your hopes for your children.</p>

                <p>Teachers impact student learning and success. Great teaching can inspire and sustain a student for
                    many years, even a lifetime. Our caring and dedicated faculty encourages students to learn for life,
                    make a difference and practice compassion. They teach our rigorous school curriculum, based on the
                    Common Core State Standards, providing the foundation that prepares our students for American higher
                    education.</p>

                <p>During and after school we offer students a broad range of opportunities to express creativity,
                    performance, athletics and inclusion. We believe in finding and developing every student’s unique
                    talents. A strong sense of community with an emphasis on the arts, sports and a social curriculum
                    reinforces our rigorous academic goals.</p>

                    stems from their natural curiosities and wonders. I want nothing more than for our students and
                    teachers to love coming to school everyday and enjoy learning together!</p>

                <p>With a special interest in the younger learner I believe that Kindergarten is vitally important, as
                    it is during these first years at school, children develop their love for learning. They build
                    friendships, learn to read and write and develop early mathematical knowledge. </p>

                <p>As an Assistant Principal I look forward to working with you and your child to ensure that our
                    program provides the best possible start for your child’s educational journey. If I can assist you
