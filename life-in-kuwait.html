                        <p>
                            The State of Kuwait is situated along the Arabian Gulf between Republic of Iraq and the
                            Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It has a total land area slightly smaller than the US State of New
                            Jersey. Its total population as of 2015 was estimated at over 4 million people, which
                            includes a highly diverse non-Kuwaiti immigrant population accounting for more than 69% of
                            residence. Although Arabic is the official language of the country, English is widely spoken
                            by a majority of the population.
                        </p>
                        <p>As one would expect the summers are hot and dry. The months of May through October tend to be
                            uncomfortably warm. However, from November through April cooler weather prevails. There will
                            be times when a warm jacket will be necessary. All apartments have heat, which can be a
                            welcome relief on cold and windy days in January or February. Rain is infrequent, but bring
                            an umbrella. At least once a year a good thunderstorm is likely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A large variety of choices present themselves to those involved in the daily life of Kuwait
                            whether it is in shopping, exercising, or socializing. People are often surprised at the
                            vast array of products available and places to go. Perhaps the one thing that Westerners
                            find most difficult is to adjust the weekend to Friday and Saturday rather than Saturday and
                            Sunday. School begins at 7:15 and ends at 2:00 for students. Some shops close in the
                            afternoon until around 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. Most stores stay open until 9:00 or 10:00 in the
                            evening. Traffic can be heavy and congested during peak times in the morning, afternoon, and
                            early evening. During the Holy Month of Ramadan, one of the most important religious events
                            in Islam, school begins at 9:00 and ends at 2:00. Stores also open later but do not close
                            until 11:00 pm. Ramadan ends with EID, a time of celebration and family gathering.
                        </p>
                        <p>The major source of Western style grocery shopping and products is the Sultan Center, Lulu
                            Hypermarket, and Carrefour. Several of these stores exist throughout the city. You will find
                            a wide variety of American and Western products. Besides the Sultan Centers, several Co-ops
                            are situated in suburban communities for easy access. The Co-ops do not have the variety but
                            they definitely have excellent choices. These shops offer more local items. Most Co-ops are
                            in areas that offer fast food restaurants and a vegetable and fruit market.
                        </p>

                        <hr>

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="span9">

                        <hr>

                        <p>The Middle Eastern concept of fruit and vegetable stores, bread shops, and butcher shops are
                            available also. For convenience, every block or two has its own "Baqalla", which is a tiny
                            shop selling a wide variety of goods. The Old Souk in Kuwait City and the open air Friday
                            market offer traditional items in an old world setting. Carpet shops, which sell carpets
                            from many parts of the Middle East, are found everywhere. These carpets vary from the most
                            practical to the highly expensive.
                        </p>

                        <p>Modern shopping malls abound in Kuwait. These malls include shops such as The Pottery Barn,
                            Debenhams, MAC, H & M, Levis, Victoria’s Secret, the Gap, Bath and Body Works, and even
                            Tiffany's just to name a few. True Value, Ace Hardware, Sears, and IKEA and others are also
                            within easy access. There is very little that one cannot buy in Kuwait.
                        </p>
                        <p>People are sometimes shocked to discover that Kuwait has over 50 McDonald's plus many Burger
                            Kings, KFC, Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Baskin Robbins, Chili’s, Johnny Rockets, Fridays,
                            Fuddruckers as well as local restaurants. A Chinese take-out can be found minutes away no
                            matter where you live. Fish is plentiful and excellent with a local fish market that sells
                            fresh fish every day. For those with a more sophisticated pallet there is a burgeoning
                            culinary arts scene in Kuwait that has developed in recent years.
                        </p>
                        <p>Movies theaters are plentiful in Kuwait. Several malls have multi-screens and the latest in
                            American films are available. If you aren't a movie buff, there are other options. Some love
                            to travel in the desert picnicking and camping. Others may be found scuba diving and
                            snorkeling, while others are pounding the pavement with their running companions and
                            exercising at a club. There are book clubs to be joined, coffee to be enjoyed at Starbucks
                            or Costas, or a leisure day to be spent sunning by a pool.

                        </p>
                        <p>A vast array of clothing is worn in Kuwait. Many Arab men wear the traditional dishdashas and
                            many Arab women choose to wear abayas and the hajab (scarf worn to cover hair), but common
                            Western wear also abounds. It is still considered inappropriate to wear shorts or sleeveless
                            blouses, but, other than that, most all type of dress is accepted. It is important to dress
                            respectfully for the culture in which we live.
                        </p>
