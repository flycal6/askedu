                <p>Welcome to the 2016-2017 school year! I am excited to see all our students back after the long summer
                    break and can't wait to meet our new Grade 6. Let's have an outstanding year!</p>

                <p><em>Nancy Abdulghafoor has been a member of the ASK community for the past 13 years. Prior to being
                    assigned as the Middle School Principal she was MS Assistant Principal, She spent four years as the
                    High School Counselor and two years as the Middle School Counselor working closely with faculty,
                    parents, and students. Nancy holds a master’s degree in Educational Leadership and is a certified
                    counselor from Lehigh University. Before going into education Nancy earned her Bachelor’s Degree in
                    Mass Communication and TV Production. However, Nancy’s passion for humanities steered her towards a
                    career in education which started in the classroom. She began at ASK teaching grades 6 and 7 Social
                    Studies. Nancy is also an ASK Alum having graduated from ASK in 1993.</em></p>

                <p>I am honored to serve you as the assistant principal at the American School of Kuwait. It is a
                    privilege to be a part of a community where parents, teachers, and students care for each other and
                    build positive relationships that support academic and social growth.</p>

                <p>As students transition into Middle School and others prepare to move on, it is my belief that ASK
                    Middle School students enter as learners and exit as leaders. We will challenge each student to grow
                    in his or her academic abilities and continue their preparation to be college-ready.</p>

                <p><em>Tim Allen has been working at the American School of Kuwait for the past six years. Tim has
                    taught in Middle School and High School over the past 15 years. Tim holds a Master’s degree in
                    Education and a Master’s in Educational Technology and Leadership. When not at school, Tim enjoys
                    spending time with his wife and three children.</em></p>

                <p>Welcome to a new and exciting school year 2016-2017! I feel lucky to have been part of ASK community
                    as a student, parent, teacher and as the middle school counselor. I have a background in psychology,
                    special education and guidance and counseling. Mostly, I am looking forward to working with your
                    child through the fun, yet sometimes challenging middle school years.</p>


                <p>My primary responsibility is to help students achieve their social, emotional and academic goals. I
                    also aim at providing your child with a safe and supportive environment in order to achieve his or
                    her goals and reach full potential. I will be available to meet with students individually or in
                    small groups to help them meet their needs. Moreover, I plan to conduct small workshops with
                    students to address topics such as study skills, conflict resolution, test anxiety as well as peer
                    relations.</p>


                <p>I believe in each student’s intrinsic worth and I am committed to being an advocate for you and your
                    child. Please feel free to reach out at any time throughout the year with questions or concerns.</p>
