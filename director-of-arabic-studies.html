                <p><span class="dropcap">W</span>elcome to the website of the American School of Kuwait. ASK is a
                    wonderful school - a place at which teachers can teach and very capable children come to learn. Our
                    1800+ students benefit from a rigorous American curriculum which prepares students to be accepted
                    into the greatest universities in the world. Our Incredibly talented faculty is the key to our
                    success - that, and we have the smartest and nicest students in the world!</p>

                    exciting part of the world with quick access either to Europe and the Mediterranean or to Southeast
                    Asia and the Far East. To be able to teach or study here and also to be able to access great places
                    to visit is a wonderful combination!</p>

                <p>ASK is the embassy school of choice in Kuwait, as well as, the choice for all American expatriates in
                    Kuwait who hold high expectations for the education of their children. We also invite talented
                    students from all over the world to join us. We have a truly international student and teacher
                    community and that makes us dynamic and unique...and fun!</p>

                    its rich history. At ASK, we believe that everyone should always: practice compassion, make a
