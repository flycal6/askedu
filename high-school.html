                <h6><a href="mailto:murphym@ask.edu.kw">Michael Murphy</a>, Principal</h6>

                <p>I am very excited to continue with a dynamic teaching and learning community in the high school this
                    year. It is a pleasure to be working with such a capable and caring group of teachers who support
                    our students through the journey of high school.</p>

                <p>High school can be a challenging and exciting time for our students. Here at the American School we
                    strive to help our students develop the confidence and skills to be successful long after they leave
                    our school. To this end, we offer a diverse and dynamic curriculum carefully designed to engage each
                    and every student and apply their learning to practical, real-life scenarios. Our goal is to produce
                    learners ready to excel in American higher education.</p>

                <p>As Principal, it is very important to me to cultivate positive relationships with our students and
                    their families. Learning is an ongoing process that we are all engaged in, all the time. To be most
                    successful in this process, we must work together and communicate openly. My door is always open to
                    students and to parents if there are any concerns or thoughts to be shared and discussed.</p>

                <p><em>Michael Murphy is from Moscow, Idaho, and has been at The American School of Kuwait for seven
                    years. Joining our school in 2009 as a high school history teacher, Michael then moved to the middle
                    school where he was Assistant Principal for two years. Before moving to Kuwait, Michael worked for
                    the University of Idaho in the College of Education. Michael has been working in the field of
                    education for ten years. During his free time, he enjoys traveling, spending time with his family

                <p>Welcome to ASK High School - itâ€™s an exciting, engaging, and passionate community, and one I am so
                    happy to be a part of! </p>

                <p>High school can be an overwhelming experience, but one of the greatest benefits to working at, or
                    attending, ASK is the privilege to work and learn alongside our many talented and dedicated
                    educators, who bring such a high level of expertise and enthusiasm to their teaching. Our faculty do
                    an amazing job of working with parents, administration, and support staff in order to facilitate a
                    high level of learning at all times, and I am excited to do my part to ensure this continues. </p>

                <p>As assistant principal, I truly believe in the importance of valuing each studentâ€™s individuality,
                    leading through compassion and understanding, and developing the whole person, through classes,
                    activities, sports, and outside interests. Throughout this year, I will strive to maintain open
                    communication with students, parents, and teachers and to assist our community in its pursuit of
                    excellence - ensuring all students are academically challenged, fully supported, and offered a
                    variety of opportunities to help them succeed both in high school and in their bright future.</p>
